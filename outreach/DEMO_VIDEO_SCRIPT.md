## The Storyboard

### 1. The Hook (0:00 - 0:10)
*Visual: You on camera (webcam bubble) or just your screen showing the "Call Now" interface.*
**Audio:**
"Hey, this is Seth. I want to show you exactly how this AI dispatcher handles a missed call at 2 AM. Watch this."

### 2. The Demonstration (0:10 - 0:40)
*Visual: You holding your phone on speakerphone near the mic, OR using the web-based 'Talk' button on your demo page.*
**Action:** Call the agent.
**Dialogue (Roleplay):**
*   **AI:** "Thanks for calling [Your HVAC Name], who am I speaking with?"
*   **You:** "Hi, this is Mike. My AC just died and it's 85 degrees in here."
*   **AI:** "I'm sorry to hear that, Mike. Is this an emergency you need someone out for tonight, or can it wait until tomorrow morning?"
*   **You:** "I need someone tonight."
*   **AI:** "Okay, I can have a technician there between 6 and 8 PM. The emergency dispatch fee is $150. Does that work for you?"
*   **You:** "Yes, that works."
*   **AI:** "Great. I've booked that for you. We'll see you soon."

### 3. The "Magic Trick" (0:40 - 0:50)
*Visual: Switch tabs to your **Live Dashboard**.*
**Action:** Point to the new row that just appeared.
**Audio:**
"Now look at this. Before I even hung up, the lead is right here on the dashboard. It captured my name, the issue, and marked it as 'Emergency'."

### 4. The Call to Action (0:50 - 1:00)
*Visual: Back to you or a simple slide with your contact info.*
**Audio:**
"It does this 24/7 without you lifting a finger. If you want to try this on your own phone, just reply to this email and I'll set you up."

## Tips for Recording
*   **Don't over-edit.** Raw and real builds more trust than a polished marketing video.
*   **Clear Audio.** Make sure the AI's voice is loud and clear on the recording.
*   **Speed.** If the call takes too long, you can speed up the middle part in post-production, but it's better if the interaction is just naturally snappy.
