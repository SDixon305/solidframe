# Step 5: Create Outreach Scripts & Strategy

## 1. Strategy Overview
**Goal:** Generate 5-10 "Hand-Raisers" (interested prospects) to demo the AI agent.
**Primary Channel:** Cold Email & Cold Calling (Hybrid approach).
**Secondary Channel:** LinkedIn/Facebook DMs (if you have a personal profile to leverage).
**The "North Star" Metric:** Number of Demos Booked.

---

## 2. Cold Email Sequence
*Subject Lines to Test:*
- Missed calls
- After-hours for {{Company Name}}
- Question about your dispatching
- {{First Name}}, quick question

### Email 1: The "Problem-Agitate-Solution" (Soft Ask)
**Subject:** Missed calls at {{Company Name}}?

Hi {{First Name}},

I’m building a tool for HVAC owners to stop losing revenue from missed calls after hours, and I wanted to get your opinion on it.

We built an AI Dispatcher that sounds exactly like a human. It answers calls 24/7, qualifies the lead ("Emergency" vs "Routine"), and can even book the appointment directly into your calendar.

I’m looking for 5 partners to test it out this month (setup fee waived).

Mind if I send over a link to a demo so you can hear what it sounds like?

Best,

[Your Name]

### Email 2: The "Evidence" (Sent 2 days later if no reply)
**Subject:** Here is the demo I mentioned

Hi {{First Name}},

I didn't hear back, but I thought you might want to hear this anyway.

Here is a recording of our AI agent handling a mock customer call: [LINK TO DEMO WEBSITE OR VIDEO]

Unlike a basic answering service that just takes a message, this actually *works* the lead.

If you think this could save you a few headaches (and a few thousand dollars) on weekends, let me know. I'd love to set it up for {{Company Name}} as a beta tester.

Best,

[Your Name]

### Email 3: The "Break Up" (Sent 4 days later)
**Subject:** Permission to close your file?

Hi {{First Name}},

I’m writing to ask if I should close your file regarding the AI Dispatcher beta program.

If you aren't interested, no worries at all—I’ll stop emailing you.

But if you are still looking for a way to handle after-hours calls without hiring more staff, just reply "Yes" and I'll get you the details.

Thanks,

[Your Name]

## 3. Cold Call Script
*Goal: Get permission to send the demo or book a 15-min discovery call.*

**Opener:**
"Hey {{First Name}}, this is [Your Name]... I’ll be honest, this is a cold call, but I’m calling about your after-hours dispatching. Do you have 30 seconds, or should I hang up?"

**The Pitch:**
"Thanks. I’m a local developer building an AI system specifically for HVAC companies. Basically, it answers your phone 24/7, sounds like a real person, and books jobs while you sleep.

I’m not trying to sell you a massive contract today. I’m just looking for a few local owners to test it out in exchange for a waived setup fee.

**The Ask:**
"Would you be open to hearing a 30-second sample of what it sounds like? I can text it to you right now."

**If YES:**
"Great, what's the best cell number?" (Send the link). "I'll call you back in 5 minutes to see what you thought."

**If NO / "We have a service":**
"Totally understand. Most services just take messages though, right? This thing actually qualifies the lead and books the slot. Tell you what, I'll send the demo link to your email, and if you hate it, you never have to hear from me again. What's your email?"

## 4. LinkedIn / Facebook DM Script
*Keep it super casual. No stiff "business" talk.*

**Message 1:**
"Hey {{First Name}}, noticed you run {{Company Name}}. Quick question—how are you guys handling missed calls on the weekends right now? Answering service?"

**Message 2 (After they reply):**
"Gotcha. The reason I ask is I just built an AI dispatcher that handles those calls automatically (and sounds surprisingly human).

I'm looking for a couple of HVAC owners to beta test it for me. Mind if I send you a link to hear a sample call?"

## 5. Objection Handling Cheat Sheet

**"Is this a robot?"**
"It is, but it uses the newest voice technology. It sounds 99% human. Most customers don't even realize they're talking to an AI until the end. I can send you a sample?"

**"We already have an answering service."**
"That's great. Most of my clients did too. The problem they found was the service just took messages, and by the time they called back, the lead was gone. Our AI books the appointment *on the call*. Would you be open to comparing them?"

**"How much is it?"**
"For the beta partners, we're waiving the $1,000 setup fee, so it's just a flat $250/month. And we have a 30-day guarantee: if it doesn't catch at least 3 leads you would've missed, I'll refund you."

**"Send me more info."**
"Sure, I'll send you the demo link. That's the best way to understand it. What's your email?"
