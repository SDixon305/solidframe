# Step 1: Define the Offer
**Status:** Draft / Ready for Review
**Date:** 2025-11-29

## 1. The Core Concept
**"The 24/7 AI Dispatcher that answers every call, qualifies every lead, and books jobs while you sleep."**

We are not selling a "chatbot." We are selling **revenue protection**. Every missed call is a potential $500+ job going to a competitor.

## 2. The Target Audience (Avatar)
**Residential HVAC Owners**
-   **Revenue:** $1M - $5M (Have volume, but maybe not a full 24/7 dispatch team).
-   **Pain Point:** Losing money on missed calls after hours/weekends; paying too much for "message-taking" services that don't actually book jobs.
-   **Desire:** Automate the busy work, capture every opportunity, look professional.

## 3. The "Grand Slam" Offer (Early Adopter / Beta)

### The Deliverables
1.  **24/7 AI Voice Agent:** Answers calls instantly, 365 days a year.
2.  **Smart Triage:** Distinguishes between "Emergency" (dispatch now) and "Routine" (book for tomorrow).
3.  **Live Dashboard:** Real-time view of all calls, transcripts, and lead status.
4.  **Instant Notifications:** SMS/Email alerts for high-priority leads.
5.  **Custom Knowledge Base:** Trained on *their* specific pricing, service area, and business rules.

### The Beta Pricing (Limited Time)
-   **Monthly Subscription:** ~~$400/mo~~ **$250/mo** (Locked in for 12 months).
-   **Setup Fee:** ~~$997~~ **WAIVED** (In exchange for a testimonial).
-   **Usage:** Includes first 500 minutes (approx. 100-150 calls). Overage at cost.

### The Risk Reversal (Guarantee)
**"The 30-Day ROI Guarantee"**
> "If our AI agent doesn't capture at least 3 qualified leads that you would have otherwise missed in the first 30 days, we will refund your subscription in full. You keep the leads."

### The Scarcity
-   **"I am only onboarding 5 partners this month to ensure white-glove service."**

## 4. The Sales Argument (Why Now?)
1.  **Speed to Lead:** 78% of customers buy from the first responder. If you don't answer, they call the next guy.
2.  **Labor Savings:** A human receptionist costs $3,000/mo. An answering service costs $400+ and just takes messages. This AI *works* for $250.
3.  **Beta Advantage:** Get in now to shape the product features (e.g., specific CRM integrations) before the price doubles.

## 5. Next Steps for Implementation
1.  **Validate:** Does this pricing feel right? (Referencing `HVAC_AI_Agency_Pricing_2025.txt`).
2.  **Assets:** We need a "One-Pager" PDF or a simple landing page section that outlines this exact offer.
3.  **Script:** We need a cold call/email script that pitches *this specific offer*.
